i3 personal configuration

This works perfectly fine in my HP elitebook (1360x768), change the outer from gasps if you have problems

Some configs (like the css style for firefox) can be taken from twily.info

Dependencies:
-I3 (Windows manager)
-I3-gasps
feh (background and image viewer)
-compton (composite manager)
-ranger (file manager)
-figlet (text format)
-acpi (system status)
-conky (system status)
-w3m [arch] or w3m-img [fedora, debian, ubuntu] (for image-previsualizer in ranger)
-screenfetch
-cmus
-firefox
